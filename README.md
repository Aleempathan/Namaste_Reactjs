## Class Summary `Chapter - 05 Let's Get Hooked` (08/03/2023)
  Chapter-05 was the continuation of previous chapter where we started to develop a food delivery app. In this chapter, we re-organised the repo structure, understood the importance of clean coding principles, different ways of exporting and importing modules(components). Then, the hero of this chapter `Hooks` got everyone hooked to their screen. It was indeed a 3 hours knowledge heavy session where foundation of hooks was laid. We used hooks to filter the restaurants based on search input. Find my version of detailed explanation of these concepts in [theory-assignment.md](https://github.com/Learn-React-With-Harshi/chapter-05-lets-get-hooked/blob/main/theory-assignment.md).

One line about this chapter : `Hook is just normal function which manages the local variable(state), which can only be modified using it's function useState() to create a state and assign a initial value and setState() to update the state.`
