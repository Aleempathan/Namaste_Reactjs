   Documenting my learning journey of [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by Akshay Saini

Class Summary Chapter - 09 Optimizing our app (22/01/2023)
This is the 9th session which means we have already crossed half of the Namaste course and started diving into advanced concepts.

The first half of the chapter was about Why to use, How to create, Where to create and When to use Custom Hooks were explained. Difference between helper functions and custom hooks were discussed with examples. We created a helper function (filtering logic) and two custom hooks (check network connection and fetch API data).

The second half of the chapter was about optimizing our app using lazy loading/ on demand loading mechanism.

Find my version of detailed explanation of these concepts in theory-assignment.md. Check coding-assignment.md for all the features that I implemented in this chapter.

One line about this chapter : Custom Hooks is similar to a normal javascript function which does some operation on the given data, but can use state and other react hooks to update the DOM (two-way binding)
